The Gremlin traversal language has a bit of a learning curve.  IDE auto-complete
isn't always useful because the traversals are not strongly typed thus all
steps pop-up. The key is knowing which steps apply to previous steps or what
is in the current traversal path.  This is an experiment to use EBNF to describe
applicable steps or i.e. what comes next.

These examples were generated using [Railroad Diagram generator](http://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui).
